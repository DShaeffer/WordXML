# WordXML
A package to manipulate Word XML documents. The templates folder includes an example custom xml part (a.k.a. schema). This custom xml part can be modified to meet your needs. The custom xml part is added to an existing word document as show in the "exampleWordXMLDoc" word document in the templates folder. This allows you to "link" common content controls/form fields in word templates.
